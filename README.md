# Author Contributions Checklist Form

## Data

**Abstract (Mandatory)**

The files &quot;mval\_mediator\_sorted.csv&quot; and &quot;mval\_outcome\_sorted.csv&quot; are two csv files that contain the linear regression model results (equation (1) and (2) in the main text) for the exposure-mediator and mediator-outcome associations. The meanings of those regression results are described in the Section 5 of the main text of our paper.

**Availability (Mandatory)**

The raw data from the Normative Aging study is not publicly available.

**Description (Mandatory if data available)**

Permissions (demonstrate that author has legitimate access to data)

Licensing information

Link to data (e.g., dataverse.org, datadryad.org; this need not be the actual link at time of submission but if not, it should indicate where the data will be deposited if the manuscript is accepted)

Data provenance, including identifier or link to original data if different than above

File format

Metadata (including data dictionary)

Version information

## Code

**Abstract (Mandatory)**

The &quot;NAS-data-analysis&quot; folder contains the main analysis code for Section 6.

The &quot;Figures2-3&quot; folder contains the code for producing Figure 2 and 3.

The &quot;Simulation\_multipleTesting&quot; folder contains the code for producing Figure 4.

The &quot;Simulation\_size\_power&quot; folder contains the code for Table 1, Table 2 and Figure 5 and an additional simulation study in Section 5.2.

The &quot;sensitivityAnalysis.R&quot; file contains sensitivity code and the results are presented in the main text and supplementary materials.

**Description (Mandatory)**

All the submitted code can be directly run.

**Optional Information (complete as necessary)**

## A modern desktop or laptop can be used to run the code.

## Instructions for Use

**Reproducibility (Mandatory)**

For each folder, the R script file can be directly run. For sensitivity analysis, the individual level data are not publicly available.

**Replication (Optional)**
